  - BY SRIKAR SEETHIRAJU

## Aim : Predicting the output class of a 28x28 pixel image in the form of CSV file.

## Method of approach used : Convolutional Neural Network
  - STEP #1: IMPORTING DATA
  - STEP #2: VISUALISATION OF THE DATASET
  - STEP #3: DATA PREPROCESSING
  - STEP #4: MODEL TRAINING
  - STEP #5: EVALUATING THE MODEL

#### Note : CSV datafiles couldnot be uplaoded as the size (~140MB) exceeds 25MB limit of Github. Dataset for this project has been taken from Super Data Science Team.
